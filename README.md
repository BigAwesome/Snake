# Snake

## Background
The project uses react functional components written in typescript. 
To run the code as a developer you'll need to install its dependencies.
1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). Tested on version [21.6.1](https://nodejs.org/dist/v21.6.1/)

   (You may need to restart your PC)
2. Install the packages used. Open a Terminal in the "Snake" folder. Run the command `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

With `npm start` you'll get a web browser displaying the project. Once development is completed these steps will not be necessary to play the game.

## Documentation and planing
The [documentation](https://github.com/BigAwesome/Snake/tree/master/docs) can be found [here](https://github.com/BigAwesome/Snake/tree/master/docs)

This is the intended process for the game.
![flow](https://github.com/BigAwesome/Snake/blob/master/docs/FlowDraft.png?raw=true)

Documentation of the software architecture and a contribution guid will follow shortly.

### Adding media
For now the folder [\src\assets\videos](https://github.com/BigAwesome/Snake/tree/master/src/assets/videos/) is intended to hold the videos. 
Online media (like youtube) could also be used.
